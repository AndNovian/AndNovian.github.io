What began as a tech support job helping customers troubleshoot Microsoft Defender turned into an obsession. Within a year, I was the go-to person for deep-dive Defender issues. And now, I am Technical Lead supporting our team’s ramp up and escalations related to the Microsoft’s XDR stack.
My toolkit? Defender for Endpoint, Identity, Cloud Apps, Azure Sentinel — and a lot of KQL. I’ve supported customers across Windows, Linux, and macOS environments, bridging operations with Intune, GPO, and SCCM. When Defender tools didn’t behave as expected, I dug into the why — helping teams trace the root cause and build solutions that actually worked in the real world.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://andnovian.github.io/about/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
